### Summary

**Summer 2025 Data Analytics Internship**

During my time as a Data Analytics Intern with the Allegheny County Department of Human Services, I was tasked with [starting a project] to better understand the needs of pregnant and postpartum individuals in the Allegheny County Jail.

I developed a Tableau dashboard, mapped out key processes through flowcharts, and synthesized reports and presentations to share my findings.

*Developed with Oracle SQL and Tableau*

### Pregnancy and incarceration are both high stress periods.

With the rise in the female jail population nationwide and in Allegheny County, there is an increased interest in bettering the experiences of pregnant and postpartum individuals in the jail.

In consideration of the positive feedback loop found between chronic maternal stress and adverse pregnancy outcomes, county- and state-wide policies have been made to improve these conditions.

### Main Contributions and Milestones
- **Flowcharts**: mapping out key processes for pregnant and postpartum individuals in ACJ
- **Tableau Dashboard**: contextualizing pregnant incarcerated individuals and their service involvement
