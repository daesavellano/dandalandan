### Summary

**Summer 2025 Data Analytics Internship**

During Summer 2025, I worked as a **Data Analytics Intern** with the Allegheny County Department of Human Services (DHS), focusing on the intersection of **maternal health and incarceration**. My exploratory project sought to better understand the needs and experiences of **pregnant and postpartum individuals in the Allegheny County Jail (ACJ)**.

I developed a **multi-page Tableau dashboard and process flowcharts** to visualize trends and key touchpoints within the system. My final report, "*Understanding Maternal Health and Support for Pregnant and Postpartum Individuals at the Allegheny County Jail (2018 Q1–2025 Q2)*," was submitted in August 2025.

*Developed with Oracle SQL and Tableau*

### Pregnancy and incarceration are both high stress periods.

Pregnancy and incarceration are both high-stress experiences—and when they overlap, they present complex health and policy challenges.

With the rise in the female jail population both nationally and locally, Allegheny County has shown a growing commitment to improving the care of pregnant and postpartum individuals in custody. Chronic maternal stress is known to contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, reinforcing a cycle of vulnerability that can persist across generations.

While correctional facilities are not required to collect pregnancy-related data, ACDHS leverages multiple data sources—such as the Offender Management System (OMS), Electronic Health Records (EHR), Birth Data, and Human Services and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) program data—to provide a more complete understanding of these individuals’ health and service needs.

### Main Contributions and Milestones

- **Flowcharts**: mapped the experiences and key procedures for pregnant and postpartum individuals in ACJ.
- **Tableau Dashboard**: visualized demographic and service involvement trends to inform cross-system collaboration.
- **Comprehensive Report**: synthesized insights into data-driven recommendations for improving maternal health support within correctional settings.

### Project Highlights

*(Specific data and visuals are confidential and not publicly shared, but sample censored information can be found at the bottom of the page.)*

Key components of the analysis include:

- Background research on maternal health in correctional environments
- Descriptive trends on demographics, jail time, recidivism, and human service involvement
- Exploration of physical and behavioral health, criminal justice, and human services engagement
- Analysis of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Hello Baby program connections
- System improvement and future work recommendations for DHS and partner agencies, including potential integration with AI-driven analytics teams

The project culminated in the creation of eight comprehensive dashboards, each focused on a specific aspect of the data—from intake protocols to program involvement and health indicators. The dashboard menu below illustrates the structure and scope of this analysis.

Due to the sensitive nature of the dataset, only sample representations of visualizations are shown. These visuals demonstrate the types of analyses conducted, including comparisons between pregnant and non-pregnant individuals, incarceration trends, and protocol mapping. The dashboard was very interactive with options for dynamic filters and custom tooltip information.

To communicate key findings and context, I created a series of presentation slides summarizing background research, system processes, and policy implications. These are then explored in higher detail in my written report. One of my favorite moments during the internship was presenting my research to a room full of DHS employees across different offices!
